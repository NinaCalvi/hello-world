<p> Figuring things out step by step, with a cup of hot chocolate and a lot of buiscuits </p>
<p><em> The most important thing to know about me is that I have an addiction with food - sweets in particular. If you have them - beware!! Do not show them to me or the will be gone. I also like staying outside - horse riding, tennis. I like talking - nothing in particular, just exchanging ideas, opinions, knowledge, perceptions of what sorrounds us. Because what does actually sorround us? Every day there is something new that is inserted in this world. I want to use technology to keep changing our world - people should always keep questioning what is sorrouding us. <strong> What is life without a bit of uncertainty? </strong></em></p>
